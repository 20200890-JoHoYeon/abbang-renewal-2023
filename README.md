## Development Story :question:

In 2019, when I was a high school senior, I was asked to develop an application by an organization called Abbang, a social cooperative conducted by the school while working as a chairman of the app development club."👍 <br />
The prototype at the time, developed through Android Studios, will be redeveloped in 2023 for current React Native learning :computer:
